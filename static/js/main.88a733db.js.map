The device can tell the severity of a seizure, and it may lead to seizure forecasting in the end. \\n By forecasting the coming seizures and sending seizure alert to the patient in advance, he/she could be able to stop the current activity and get prepared for the seizure, which can be able to prevent potential danger and save lives. The ability to forecast seizures has long been desired, discussed, and explored. Scientists are now detecting abnormal brain waves or changes in nervous system measurements, like heart rate and breathing to predict seizures. \\n By monitoring the patient activity and data analysis, the smartwatch can be able to detect irregular shaking of the patient and record the ongoing seizure, as well as sending emergency message in case the tonic-clonic(shaking) seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, which could be dangerous and he/she must be sent to hospital according to doctor.\",\n\t\t\t\"images\": []\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"process\": {\n\t\t\t\"text\": \"Starting with obervation and research, we decided the track to go: design a smartwatch application for epileptic patient.\",\n\t\t\t\"images\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"saw_process_brainstorming.png\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"caption\": \"Before the group gathering, every group member did observations and research to find out the fields related to epilepsy.
