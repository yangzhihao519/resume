The Story
=========

Problem
-------

#### HORIZON 2020 is the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. There are 31638 rows in Horizon 2020's database for participations, while there is another table for projects which contains 7553 rows. It's not easy to find out useful information from plain texts and it also requires technical skills to understand the data.  

#### Vinnova, the Swedish Innovation Agency, is in charge of the management of Horizon 2020 in Sweden. In order to understand their performances in this program and make strategic future plan, specialists from Swedish companies, universities, organisations and other governmental agencies will need to spend hours or even days of work in generating a report based on the complicated data from European Commission, and they do send requests to Vinnova for instructions and more complex questions. Although Vinnova organizes regular workshops for training specialists from external organizations how to use Horizon 2020's database, it requires time and energy.  

#### The most common questions regarding Horizon 2020 are:  

#### 1\. How does the participation look like per region/county for a certain country? Which pillars, programmes and subprogrammes do a chosen organisation participate in and what are the projects (ID, title and abstract)?  

#### 2\. How does the participation look like per programme for a given country (one or all) and region (one, several or all)?; Which organisations participate in which programmes and topic.  

#### 3\. How are the collaboration patterns for 1) Countries 2) for a given Organisation look like?  

Solution
--------

#### To make it easier to understand Horizon 2020's data set and create a easy data manipulation, a web-based online data visualisation tool was created to support data analysis within Horizon 2020. This visualisation tool is able to:  

#### 1\. Provide an overview of the data;  

#### 2\. Allow organizations & countries to view their participation in H2020;  

#### 3\. Elicit collaboration patterns.  

#### Horizon 2020's data is hierarchical and includes several levels from pillars all the way down to projects. And organisations are involved in every level.

#### In our solution, to show the hierarchical structure more clearly and support intuitive data manipulation, sankey diagram is utilized to present the data.

Process
-------

#### We utilized an iterative process during the development. Starting with understanding the requirements, we make design proposals, which later on were turned into working prototype that can be evaluated though usability testing. And based on the results of the evaluation, new design will be proposed, and a circle of development will begin.  

#### This is a agile development process. Apart from daily team briefing, we also had weekly meeting to make sure everything was on track.

#### Sketch: two types of sketches(shown below) were come up within the initial stage. Although both of them used sankey diagram, they were in different directions: the tree in the left one spread horizontally, while the right one spread vertically. After a debate on which one was better to support the purpose and also a discussion with our supervisor and mentor, we thought the horizontal tree was a better solution since it enabled a natural interaction without scrolling the webpage down, and it was easier and clearer to show the labels for each box.

#### Mid-Fi Prototype: based on the sketch, a mid-fi prototype was designed using Sketch. By using InVision App, we built an interactive prototype to present our visualisation idea in a department meeting and received positive feedback.

#### Hi-Fi Prototype and Redesign: using the mid-fi prototype, a working prototype was built, based on which we had our first round of usability testing. From the testing, lots of usability issues were exposed. After the analysis of the evaluation results, a major redesign was carried out and the Hi-Fi prototype was built. One important change in the redesign was to move sidebar from right to left. The sidebar is served to show detailed information according to the selection in the visualisation. In the usability testing, we found that many participants ignored the right sidebar and had a difficult time in finding information. One reason we found was that people are used to view things from left to right, and the participants focused on the visualisation on the left and didn't pay much attention on the right sidebar.

#### Implementation: The front-end components was built by ReactJs. And D3 Js library was used to create the visualisation. The front-end and back-end communicate with each other by the REST APIs. The image below shows the implementation structure.

#### Evaluation: Mainly two round of usability testing were carried out, one was for the mid-fi working prototype, and the another for the Hi-Fi working prototype.  

#### \- First round(6 participants): the evaluation was mainly used to find out the usability issues within the visualisation tool. Using a screen video recorder, we ask our participants to answer 25 pre-defined short questions by using our tool while thinking aloud. Time spent and error rate were noted for analysis afterwards.  

#### \- Second round(4 participants)): the tests were designed to observe how participants would use our tool to solve real problem in their daily work. We prepared 3 tasks and 5 topics. Participants were told to think aloud and use our tool to complete their chosen task(e.g. create 3 powerpoint slides) regarding the chosen topic(e.g. "How is Sweden doing in Horizon 2020 compared to other Nordic countries?").

Result
------

#### It took 4 months to complete this project. Our visualisation tool was released on Oct 26, 2016 and is now online at http://h2020viz.vinnova.se.

#### We were invited to present this visualisation tool at the conference "Spelplan Europa (Gameplan Europe) " held in Stockholm to demonstrate how this visualisation tool could be used for strategic plan.
