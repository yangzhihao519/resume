It’s been discovered that conductance spikes just before someone has a seizure. The device can tell the severity of a seizure, and it may lead to seizure forecasting in the end. \n By forecasting the coming seizures and sending seizure alert to the patient in advance, he/she could be able to stop the current activity and get prepared for the seizure, which can be able to prevent potential danger and save lives. The ability to forecast seizures has long been desired, discussed, and explored. Scientists are now detecting abnormal brain waves or changes in nervous system measurements, like heart rate and breathing to predict seizures. \n By monitoring the patient activity and data analysis, the smartwatch can be able to detect irregular shaking of the patient and record the ongoing seizure, as well as sending emergency message in case the tonic-clonic(shaking) seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, which could be dangerous and he/she must be sent to hospital according to doctor.",
